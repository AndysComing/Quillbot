# Quillbot

Quillbot v1.0.2.1

A bot made in python to automatically complete Quill.org assignments. Made using the Selenium package.

Instructions:
Run main.exe, and put in your credentials. Typically, most school accounts you can login with google, so press the "Login with Google" button. Otherwise, press "Login with Email". If you want to login manually, simply leave the email and password field blank. You can specify a wait time as a period of time to wait in between answering each question. This is recommended to set to a relatively high number, as teachers can view how long each question took you. Once you login, simply select your class and the bot will automatically complete all avaliable assignments.
